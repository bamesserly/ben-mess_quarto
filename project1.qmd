Inspired by the [famous plot](https://www.symmetrymagazine.org/article/october-2009/deconstruction-livingston-plot)
 from M. Stanley Livingston showing accelerator center-of-mass energy as
a function of time, our plots show the progressions of neutrino detector
fiducial mass and interaction vertex resolution.

The history and future of neutrino detectors is an exciting story for particle
physicists designing and improving these detectors. We extracted and estimated
two quantities characteristic of all neutrino detectors spanning back to the
first neutrino observation. These two quantities – position resolution and
detector mass – plotted on the log scale, tell a tale of technological growth,
scientific priorities, and scientific mastery.

Experiments did not always prioritize documenting or knowing these quantities,
so we developed estimation methods to calculate these quantities. Spanning
engineering, chemistry, and particle physics, these estimation techniques
bolstered direct quotations and consistency checks. For more info on the
dataset and our methodology, see our original presentation

## What's the latest?

This work is being prepared for early 2025 publication with student Adam
Rothman (Carleton College, MN) and [Dr. Adam Lister](https://www.adam-lister.com/) (University of Wisconsin, Madison).

This work began as a part of [the 2017 International Neutrino Summer School at Fermilab](https://indico.fnal.gov/event/13429/overview). Thanks to Professor Mark Messier for
the idea and to original collaborators including Dr. Lister, [Dr. Shivesh Mandalia](https://shivesh.org/), James Ellison, and David Friant.
