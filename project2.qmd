During the several years that our lab at UMN was building the Mu2e tracking
detector, I developed and maintained several python apps to collect, manage,
and analyze construction metadata, as well as guide our many student
technicians through construction of a single detector module.

We had to track tens of thousands of straws and many other components through
every step. All the data was fed into a SQL database, and jupyter notebooks and
pandas scripts analyzed the data for rapid problem solving and projcess
improvements.
