My work spans particle detector\nconstruction, data science, high-performance computing, machine learning, and\neducation.\n\nI research the Standard Model theory of fundamental particle physics, and I\nconduct experiments that try to prove it wrong.\n\nI also do work in science communication, STEM education and mentorship, and I\nwas recently an assistant professor at [St.\nOlaf](https://wp.stolaf.edu/physics/) and\n[Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/).\n\n:::\n\n<!--\n\nSome of my recent work includes building the electron tracking detector for the\nMu2e experiment, designing and building a systematics software toolkit for\ngeneral particle physics analyses, and measuring neutrino interactions at\nFermilab.\n\n-->\n",
