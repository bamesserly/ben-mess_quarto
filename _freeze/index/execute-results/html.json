At Fermilab and the University of\nMinnesota, I built and operated particle detectors to collect trillions of\nimages of particle collisions. I led technical teams, maintained production\nsoftware, and developed neural networks to learn about the fundamental quantum\nnature of our universe.\n\nI have 10+ years of experience in technical mentorship and teaching across\nphysics, software, data science, and ML. I place strong emphasis on clear and\naccessible technical communication.\n\n:::\n\n<!--\n\nSome of my recent work includes building the electron tracking detector for the\nMu2e experiment, designing and building a systematics software toolkit for\ngeneral particle physics analyses, and measuring neutrino interactions at\nFermilab.\n\n-->\n",
