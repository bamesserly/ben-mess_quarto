I research neutrinos and muons on [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/)\nexperiments that test the Standard Model of particle physics. I have expertise in\nparticle beams and detectors, high-performance computing, and data science. I\nalso do work in science communication, STEM education and mentorship, and I was\nrecently an assistant professor at St. Olaf and Carleton Colleges. I hold a\nPh.D and M.S. in physics from the University of Pittsburgh and a B.A. in\nphysics and philosophy from Bowdoin College.\n\n\n# Research Summary\n\nMy research activities span the field of experimental particle physics: I both\nbuild and operate particle detectors, and I model and analyze the images of\nparticle collisions that they collect.\n\n![](images/minerva_photo.jpg){height=320px} ![](images/mu2e_tracker.jpg){height=320px}\n<figcaption>The MINERvA detector (left) and Mu2e tracker (right) are relatively\nsmall as particle detectors go.</figcaption>\n\n<break>\n<!--\n\n<center>\n![](images/minerva_photo.jpg){height=320px} ![](images/mu2e_tracker.jpg){height=320px}\n![](images/mu2e_lab.jpg){height=320px}\n</center>\n<figcaption>(Top) The MINERvA detector and Mu2e tracker are relatively small as particle detectors go.

Our\ndetectors can collect trillions of particle images. To extract the signals\nwithin, I also work in the areas of statistics, data science, computer science,\nmachine learning, and high-performance computing.\n\n<center>\n![Image of a neutrino collision in the MINERvA detector](images/Target3DISEvent.jpg){width=85% .external}\n</center>\n\nMy scientific focus is the Standard Model of particle physics -- an incredibly\nsuccessful theory describing fundamental particles and the interactions\nbetween them. The Standard model seems to only make correct predictions, but\ncan't explain some conspicuous phenomena like dark matter and gravity.\nAccording to the Standard Model, there are 17 fundamental particles. I\nstudy two of them: neutrinos and muons.\n\n**Neutrinos** are extremely numerous, ghostly particles with a trace amount of\nmass. They're very hard to detect, and we still have a lot to learn about them.\nThe big questions in neutrino physics are: what exactly is the neutrino's mass?\nHow do neutrinos behave differently from their antiparticles? And might they\neven be their own antiparticles? Answering these questions will help us better\nunderstand the shortcomings of the Standard Model and help answer: why *this*\nuniverse?\n\n**Muons** are the heavier sister particles to electrons. The Mu2e experiment at\nFermilab will search for a type of muon decay that is not allowed by the\nStandard Model, but that does happen in hypothetical *Beyond* Standard Model\ntheories. The outcome of the Mu2e experiment will either be to wipe out whole\ncategories of theories or pave the road to a new model.\n\nI focus specifically on neutrino beam technology and nuclear neutrino\ninteractions. I work on several Fermilab experiments, in particular the MINERvA\nexperiment, and I've also studied neutrino beams at CERN. On the Mu2e\nexperiment I helped build the electron tracking detector, and now I develop\nmachine learning-based calibration and analysis techniques. I also designed an\n[open science particle physics analysis software\ntoolkit](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_03046/epjconf_chep2021_03046.html)\nas a member of the MINERvA collaboration.\n\n<center>\n![](images/mu2e_lab.jpg){height=320px}\n<figcaption>The Mu2e detector under constrution at UMN circa 2022</figcaption>\n</center>\n\n# Teaching, Communication, and Community\n\nI also do work in physics education and community, with emphasis on a few areas\nwhere I found I can most effectively contribute to advancing DEAI in STEM:\nparticipation in advocacy groups, evidence-based teaching strategies,\nindividual research mentorship, public science outreach, and\nopen science.\n\nIn 2022 and 2023, I was Adjunct Assistant Professor at [St. Olaf\nCollege](https://wp.stolaf.edu/physics/) teaching the advanced lab course, and\nVisiting Assistant Professor at [Carleton\nCollege](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/), where I taught the intro\nphysics survey course and researched neutrino detectors with a summer student.\nAt Minnesota, I'm a member of the [Climate and Diversity\nCommittee](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/spa-cdc/home), I have many graduate\nand undergraduate student research partnerships, and this semester, I'm\nassisting/co-teaching Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics.\n\n<!--\n, These are the areas I've found where I\ncan most effectively contribute to advancing DEAI in physics.\n\nThese efforts reflect the areas where Iâ€™ve found I can most effectively\ncontribute to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, particularly\nin supporting underrepresented groups.\n\n\nI do work in physics education and community focusing on issues of diversity,\nequity, and access in STEM. The things I focus on include:\n\n* Collaboration with and participation in advocacy groups\n* Teaching with evidence-based strategies\n* Individual student research partnerships and mentorship\n* Public outreach and scientific communication\n* Open science\n\nThe areas I've found where I most effectively advance issues of diversity,\nequity, and access in STEM include:\n-->\n\n\n# Other Interests \n\nI play lots of different sports like ice hockey, cross country skiing, rock\nclimbing, and I captained my college rugby team. I'm a long time Lindy Hop\nswing dancer, community organizer, instructor, DJ, and competitor. I love to\nexpress myself and connect with others through dance. I enjoy strategy games,\nand analyzing games with statistics. I'm currently solving the collaborative\ncard game, Hanabi, using reinforcement machine learning. My second academic\nlove is the history and philosophy of physics -- in particular the questions of\nhow scientific ideas develop and how they inform pedagogy.\n\n\n![](images/skiing.jpg){height=325px} ![](images/dancing.jpg){height=325px}\n<figcaption> Skiing in Wisconsin (left) and jamming in Pittsburgh (right).</figcaption>\n",
