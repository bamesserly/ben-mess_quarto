At the\nUniversity of Minnesota and [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) I built particle\ndetectors to collect trillions of images of particle collisions and the\nML/analysis pipelines to process them -- all in an effort to understand the\nnature of the universe. I continue to collaborate on research at Minnesota.\n\nMy physics research focused on neutrinos and muons -- fundamental particles in\nthe Standard Model -- and I worked on the experiments at Fermilab that studied\nthem. I specialized in particle beams and detectors, high-performance\ncomputing, and data science. I also did work in science communication, STEM\neducation and mentorship, and I was an assistant professor at St. Olaf and\nCarleton Colleges. I hold a Ph.D and M.S. in physics from the University of\nPittsburgh and a B.A. in physics and philosophy from Bowdoin College.\n\n# Physics Research\n\nMy colleagues and I built some of the most complex measurement systems in the\nworld. These detectors are completely custom, gymnasium-sized digital cameras\nthat take pictures of subatomic particles. They collect trillions of collision\nimages, and extracting meaningful signals requires hardware design, distributed\ncomputing, statistics, and machine learning at massive scale.\n\n![](images/minerva_photo.jpg){height=320px} ![](images/mu2e_tracker.jpg){height=320px}\n<figcaption>The MINERvA detector (left) and Mu2e tracker (right) are relatively\nsmall as particle detectors go.</figcaption>\n\n<break>\n\nThese systems study the Standard Model of particle physics -- an incredibly\nsuccessful theory describing fundamental particles and their interactions.\nThe Standard Model makes correct predictions but can't explain phenomena like\ndark matter and gravity. I focused on two of its 17 fundamental particles:\nneutrinos and muons.\n\n<center>\n![Image of a neutrino collision in the MINERvA detector](images/Target3DISEvent.jpg){width=85% .external}\n</center>\n\n**Neutrinos** are extremely numerous, ghostly particles with a trace amount of\nmass. They're very hard to detect, and we still have a lot to learn about them.\nThe big questions in neutrino physics are: what exactly is the neutrino's mass?\nHow do neutrinos behave differently from their antiparticles? And might they\neven be their own antiparticles? Answering these questions will help us better\nunderstand the shortcomings of the Standard Model and help answer: why *this*\nuniverse?\n\n**Muons** are the heavier sister particles to electrons. The Mu2e experiment at\nFermilab will search for a type of muon decay that is not allowed by the\nStandard Model, but that does happen in hypothetical *Beyond* Standard Model\ntheories. The outcome of the Mu2e experiment will either be to wipe out whole\ncategories of theories or pave the road to a new model.\n\nI focused on neutrino beam technology and nuclear neutrino interactions,\nworking on several Fermilab experiments, particularly MINERvA, and studying\nneutrino beams at CERN. On the Mu2e experiment, I helped build the electron\ntracking detector and developed machine learning-based calibration and analysis\ntechniques. I continue to collaborate on neutrino research papers and advise\ngraduate students on ML applications in particle physics. I also designed an\n[open science particle physics analysis software\ntoolkit](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_03046/epjconf_chep2021_03046.html)\nas a member of the MINERvA collaboration.\n\n<center>\n![](images/mu2e_lab.jpg){height=320px}\n<figcaption>The Mu2e detector under construction at UMN circa 2022</figcaption>\n</center>\n\n# Technical Leadership & Mentorship\n\nI've mentored engineers and researchers across physics, production software,\ndata engineering, and machine learning. I was a professor at St. Olaf and\nCarleton Colleges teaching both lab and traditional courses, and continue to\nadvise graduate students on ML applications in particle physics experiments.\nClear technical communication and mentorship to all audiences are skills I've\ndeveloped over years and value deeply.\n\n<!--\n, These are the areas I've found where I\ncan most effectively contribute to advancing DEAI in physics.\n\nThese efforts reflect the areas where I’ve found I can most effectively\ncontribute to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, particularly\nin supporting underrepresented groups.\n\n\nI do work in physics education and community focusing on issues of diversity,\nequity, and access in STEM. The things I focus on include:\n\n* Collaboration with and participation in advocacy groups\n* Teaching with evidence-based strategies\n* Individual student research partnerships and mentorship\n* Public outreach and scientific communication\n* Open science\n\nThe areas I've found where I most effectively advance issues of diversity,\nequity, and access in STEM include:\n-->\n\n\n# Other Interests \n\nI play lots of different sports like ice hockey, cross country skiing, rock\nclimbing, and rugby. I'm a long time Lindy Hop swing dancer, community\norganizer, instructor, DJ, and competitor. I love to express myself and connect\nwith others through dance. I enjoy strategy games, and analyzing games with\nstatistics. I'm currently solving the collaborative card game, Hanabi, using\nreinforcement machine learning. My second academic love is the history and\nphilosophy of physics -- in particular the questions of how scientific ideas\ndevelop and how they inform pedagogy.\n\n\n![](images/skiing.jpg){height=325px} ![](images/dancing.jpg){height=325px}\n<figcaption> Skiing in Wisconsin (left) and jamming in Pittsburgh (right).</figcaption>\n",
