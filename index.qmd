### Welcome to my personal website!

My research is in high energy particle physics with focuses on both detector
construction and data analysis.

Some of my recent work includes building the electron tracking detector for the
Mu2e experiment, designing and building a systematics software toolkit for
general particle physics analyses, and measuring neutrino interactions at
Fermilab.

I'm interested undergraduate physics education, and I was recently a visiting
professor at [St. Olaf](https://wp.stolaf.edu/physics/) and
[Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/).
