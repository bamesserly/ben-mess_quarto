:::{#hero-heading}

I'm an experimental nuclear and particle physicist at the [University of
Minnesota](https://cse.umn.edu/physics). My work spans particle detector
construction, data science, high-performance computing, machine learning, and
education.

I research the Standard Model theory of fundamental particle physics, and I
conduct experiments that try to prove it wrong.

I also do work in science communication, STEM education and mentorship, and I
was recently an assistant professor at [St.
Olaf](https://wp.stolaf.edu/physics/) and
[Carleton](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/).

Some of my recent work includes building the electron tracking detector for the
Mu2e experiment, designing and building a systematics software toolkit for
general particle physics analyses, and measuring neutrino interactions at
Fermilab.
