I'm a machine learning engineer at [SDG](https://www.solutiondesign.com/),
building everything from cloud infrastructure to data pipelines to LLM agents.

I have a PhD in nuclear and particle physics. At Fermilab and the University of
Minnesota, I built and operated particle detectors to collect trillions of
images of particle collisions. I led technical teams, maintained production
software, and developed neural networks to learn about the fundamental quantum
nature of our universe.

I have 10+ years of experience in technical mentorship and teaching across
physics, software, data science, and ML. I place strong emphasis on clear and
accessible technical communication.

Some of my recent work includes building the electron tracking detector for the
Mu2e experiment, designing and building a systematics software toolkit for
general particle physics analyses, and measuring neutrino interactions at
Fermilab.
