## How to Make a Neutrino Beam

Though we've been making neutrino beams for decades, they're fundamentally
difficult to control and monitor. Yet understanding them is critical to our
experiments.

The trouble is primarily that neutrinos have no electrical charge, so they're
hard to manipulate, shape into beams, and monitor.

The strategy to create a neutrino beam is to use a proton beam to create pions
which naturally decay into neutrinos: $\pi \rightarrow \mu \rightarrow \nu_\mu$.

Protons and pions are charged, so by steering those with magnets first, we have
some control over neutrino direction and energy. Ideally, we'd have
monoenergetic and highly collimated neutrino beams, but in practice that's not
possible, and our beams are wideband.

## Beam Simulation

To help understand our beam and quantify our uncertaintes, we use detailed
models of the entire beamline and the relevant physics processes.

I've worked on many aspects of beam simulation and monitoring, but here I
highlight how small asymmetries in the beamline apparatus can lead to
complicated fluxes at your detector.

The neutrino heat map across the front face is very sensitive to neutrino
energy. Lack of azimuthal symmetry is due to small asymmetries in the beam
apparatus.
