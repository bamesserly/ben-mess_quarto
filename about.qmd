I'm a machine learning engineer at [SDG](https://www.solutiondesign.com/),
building ML and data systems for diverse clients.

My background is as an experimental nuclear and particle physicist. At the
University of Minnesota and [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/) I built particle
detectors to collect trillions of images of particle collisions and the
ML/analysis pipelines to process them -- all in an effort to understand the
nature of the universe. I continue to collaborate on research at Minnesota.

My physics research focused on neutrinos and muons -- fundamental particles in
the Standard Model -- and I worked on the experiments at Fermilab that studied
them. I specialized in particle beams and detectors, high-performance
computing, and data science. I also did work in science communication, STEM
education and mentorship, and I was an assistant professor at St. Olaf and
Carleton Colleges. I hold a Ph.D and M.S. in physics from the University of
Pittsburgh and a B.A. in physics and philosophy from Bowdoin College.

# Physics Research

My colleagues and I built some of the most complex measurement systems in the
world. These detectors are completely custom, gymnasium-sized digital cameras
that take pictures of subatomic particles. They collect trillions of collision
images, and extracting meaningful signals requires hardware design, distributed
computing, statistics, and machine learning at massive scale.

These systems study the Standard Model of particle physics -- an incredibly
successful theory describing fundamental particles and their interactions.
The Standard Model makes correct predictions but can't explain phenomena like
dark matter and gravity. I focused on two of its 17 fundamental particles:
neutrinos and muons.

**Neutrinos** are extremely numerous, ghostly particles with a trace amount of
mass. They're very hard to detect, and we still have a lot to learn about them.
The big questions in neutrino physics are: what exactly is the neutrino's mass?
How do neutrinos behave differently from their antiparticles? And might they
even be their own antiparticles? Answering these questions will help us better
understand the shortcomings of the Standard Model and help answer: why *this*
universe?

**Muons** are the heavier sister particles to electrons. The Mu2e experiment at
Fermilab will search for a type of muon decay that is not allowed by the
Standard Model, but that does happen in hypothetical *Beyond* Standard Model
theories. The outcome of the Mu2e experiment will either be to wipe out whole
categories of theories or pave the road to a new model.

I focused on neutrino beam technology and nuclear neutrino interactions,
working on several Fermilab experiments, particularly MINERvA, and studying
neutrino beams at CERN. On the Mu2e experiment, I helped build the electron
tracking detector and developed machine learning-based calibration and analysis
techniques. I continue to collaborate on neutrino research papers and advise
graduate students on ML applications in particle physics. I also designed an
[open science particle physics analysis software
toolkit](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_03046/epjconf_chep2021_03046.html)
as a member of the MINERvA collaboration.

# Technical Leadership & Mentorship

I've mentored engineers and researchers across physics, production software,
data engineering, and machine learning. I was a professor at St. Olaf and
Carleton Colleges teaching both lab and traditional courses, and continue to
advise graduate students on ML applications in particle physics experiments.
Clear technical communication and mentorship to all audiences are skills I've
developed over years and value deeply.

, These are the areas I've found where I
can most effectively contribute to advancing DEAI in physics.

These efforts reflect the areas where I’ve found I can most effectively
contribute to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, particularly
in supporting underrepresented groups.


I do work in physics education and community focusing on issues of diversity,
equity, and access in STEM. The things I focus on include:

* Collaboration with and participation in advocacy groups
* Teaching with evidence-based strategies
* Individual student research partnerships and mentorship
* Public outreach and scientific communication
* Open science

# Other Interests 

I play lots of different sports like ice hockey, cross country skiing, rock
climbing, and rugby. I'm a long time Lindy Hop swing dancer, community
organizer, instructor, DJ, and competitor. I love to express myself and connect
with others through dance. I enjoy strategy games, and analyzing games with
statistics. I'm currently solving the collaborative card game, Hanabi, using
reinforcement machine learning. My second academic love is the history and
philosophy of physics -- in particular the questions of how scientific ideas
develop and how they inform pedagogy.
