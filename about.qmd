I'm an experimental nuclear and particle physicist at the University of
Minnesota. I research neutrinos and muons on [Fermilab](https://www.fnal.gov/)
experiments that test the Standard Model of particle physics. I have expertise in
particle beams and detectors, high-performance computing, and data science. I
also do work in science communication, STEM education and mentorship, and I was
recently an assistant professor at St. Olaf and Carleton Colleges. I hold a
Ph.D and M.S. in physics from the University of Pittsburgh and a B.A. in
physics and philosophy from Bowdoin College.


# Research Summary

My research activities span the field of experimental particle physics: I both
build and operate particle detectors, and I model and analyze the images of
particle collisions that they collect.

The detectors my colleagues and I build are incredible projects -- completely
custom-built, gymnasium-sized digital cameras that take pictures of particles
and regularly set new human limits on energy, engineering, and technology. Our
detectors can collect trillions of particle images. To extract the signals
within, I also work in the areas of statistics, data science, computer science,
machine learning, and high-performance computing.

My scientific focus is the Standard Model of particle physics -- an incredibly
successful theory describing fundamental particles and the interactions
between them. The Standard model seems to only make correct predictions, but
can't explain some conspicuous phenomena like dark matter and gravity.
According to the Standard Model, there are 17 fundamental particles. I
study two of them: neutrinos and muons.

**Neutrinos** are extremely numerous, ghostly particles with a trace amount of
mass. They're very hard to detect, and we still have a lot to learn about them.
The big questions in neutrino physics are: what exactly is the neutrino's mass?
How do neutrinos behave differently from their antiparticles? And might they
even be their own antiparticles? Answering these questions will help us better
understand the shortcomings of the Standard Model and help answer: why *this*
universe?

**Muons** are the heavier sister particles to electrons. The Mu2e experiment at
Fermilab will search for a type of muon decay that is not allowed by the
Standard Model, but that does happen in hypothetical *Beyond* Standard Model
theories. The outcome of the Mu2e experiment will either be to wipe out whole
categories of theories or pave the road to a new model.

I focus specifically on neutrino beam technology and nuclear neutrino
interactions. I work on several Fermilab experiments, in particular the MINERvA
experiment, and I've also studied neutrino beams at CERN. On the Mu2e
experiment I helped build the electron tracking detector, and now I develop
machine learning-based calibration and analysis techniques. I also designed an
[open science particle physics analysis software
toolkit](https://www.epj-conferences.org/articles/epjconf/abs/2021/05/epjconf_chep2021_03046/epjconf_chep2021_03046.html)
as a member of the MINERvA collaboration.

# Teaching, Communication, and Community

I also do work in physics education and community, with emphasis on a few areas
where I found I can most effectively contribute to advancing DEAI in STEM:
participation in advocacy groups, evidence-based teaching strategies,
individual research mentorship, public science outreach, and
open science.

In 2022 and 2023, I was Adjunct Assistant Professor at [St. Olaf
College](https://wp.stolaf.edu/physics/) teaching the advanced lab course, and
Visiting Assistant Professor at [Carleton
College](https://www.carleton.edu/physics-astronomy/), where I taught the intro
physics survey course and researched neutrino detectors with a summer student.
At Minnesota, I'm a member of the [Climate and Diversity
Committee](https://sites.google.com/umn.edu/spa-cdc/home), I have many graduate
and undergraduate student research partnerships, and this semester, I'm
assisting/co-teaching Introduction to Nuclear and Particle Physics.

These efforts reflect the areas where Iâ€™ve found I can most effectively
contribute to advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion in STEM, particularly
in supporting underrepresented groups.


I do work in physics education and community focusing on issues of diversity,
equity, and access in STEM. The things I focus on include:

* Collaboration with and participation in advocacy groups
* Teaching with evidence-based strategies
* Individual student research partnerships and mentorship
* Public outreach and scientific communication
* Open science

# Other Interests 

I play lots of different sports like ice hockey, cross country skiing, rock
climbing, and I captained my college rugby team. I'm a long time Lindy Hop
swing dancer, community organizer, instructor, DJ, and competitor. I love to
express myself and connect with others through dance. I enjoy strategy games,
and analyzing games with statistics. I'm currently solving the collaborative
card game, Hanabi, using reinforcement machine learning. My second academic
love is the history and philosophy of physics -- in particular the questions of
how scientific ideas develop and how they inform pedagogy.
